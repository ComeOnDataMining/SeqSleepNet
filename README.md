These are source code and experimental setup for the __MASS database__, used in our above arXiv preprint. Although the networks have many things in common, we try to separate them and to make them work independently to ease exploring them invididually.

Currently, _E2E-ARNN_ and _E2E-MultitaskARNN_ baselines are availabel. We are currently cleaning others and and will update them very shortly.

How to run:
-------------
1. Download the databases
- __MASS database__ is available [here](https://massdb.herokuapp.com/en/). Information on how to obtain it can be found therein.
2. Data preparation
- Change directory to `./data_processing/`
- Run `main_run.m`
3. Network training and testing
- Change directory to a specific network in `./tensorflow_net/`, for example `./tensorflow_net/E2E-ARNN/`
- Run a bash script, i.e. `bash run.sh`, to repeat 20 cross-validation folds.  
_Note1:_ You may want to modify and script to make use of your computational resources, such as place a few process them on multiple GPUs. If you want to run multiple processes on a single GPU, you may want to modify the Tensorflow source code to change __GPU options__ when initializing a Tensorflow session. 
4. Evaluation
- Execute a specific evaluation Matlab script, for example `eval_e2e_arnn.m`

Environment:
-------------
- Matlab v7.3 (for data preparation)
- Python3
- Tensorflow GPU 1.3.0 (for network training and evaluation)
